TASK: STOCK FUNCTION
NAME: Iulia Corici

Please note that you will need a Linux based (sub)system for compiling the project!
A little help in understanding what I have done:

-> to compile the task, you only need to run "make" in the terminal;
(this way all the files will be compiled using the build rule from the Makefile)
-> to clear the object and executables files, please run "make clean" in the terminal.

-> in order to test any method from the STOCK task, you will need these guidelines:

    - for "addBasicSecurityInfo(securityID, industry, description, listOfBoardMemebers)"
        just type "addInfo" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example: 

        COMMAND: addInfo
        INSERT securityID = 1
        INSERT industry = economy
        INSERT description = general economy
        INSERT (with commas) the board members' list = Alex Petrescu,Ana Barbieru,Gica Petrescu

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - for "addTick(securityID, price, timestamp)"
        just type "addTick" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example: 

        COMMAND: addTick
        INSERT securityID = 1
        INSERT timestamp = 34
        INSERT price = 12
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - for "allTimeHigh(securityID)"
        just type "highest" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example: 

        COMMAND: highest
        INSERT securityID = 1
        95
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - for "allTimeLow(securityID)"
        just type "lowest" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example: 

        COMMAND: lowest
        INSERT securityID = 1
        12
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - for "getAllPriceHistory(securityID, startTime, endTime)"
        just type "history" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example:

        COMMAND: history
        INSERT securityID = 1
        INSERT startTime = 3
        INSERT endTime = 678
