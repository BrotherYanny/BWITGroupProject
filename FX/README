TASK: FX FUNCTION
NAME: Iulia Corici

Please note that you will need a Linux based (sub)system for compiling the project!
A little help in understanding what I have done:

-> to compile the task, you only need to run "make" in the terminal;
(this way all the files will be compiled using the build rule from the Makefile)
-> to clear the object and executables files, please run "make clean" in the terminal.

-> in order to test any method from the FX task, you will need these guidelines:

    - for "addForeignExchangeValue(fromCurrency, toCurrency, price, timestamp)"
        just type "addFX" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example:

        COMMAND: addFX
        INSERT fromCurrency = USD
        INSERT toCurrency = EUR
        INSERT price = 12
        INSERT timestamp = 123

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - for "displayTop10RecentPrices() "
        just type "displayTopTen" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example: 

        COMMAND: displayTopTen

        THESE ARE TOP 1O RECENT PRICES 
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        USD-EUR at timestamp: 123.000000, and PRICE: 12.000000
        CAD-EUR at timestamp: 76.000000, and PRICE: 1.500000
        USD-CAD at timestamp: 45.000000, and PRICE: 6.000000

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - for "displayTopMostRecentPricesForCurrencyPair(fromCurrency, toCurrency, numberOfPrices) "
        just type "displayTopMostRecent" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example: 

        COMMAND: displayTopMostRecent
        INSERT fromCurrency = USD
        INSERT toCurrency = CAD
        INSERT number = 3

        THESE ARE TOP 3 MOST RECENT PRICES FOR USD-CAD
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        timestamp: 45.000000, and price: 6.000000

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - for "displayBestPriceToBuyCurrency(fromCurrency, toCurrency)"
        just type "bestPrice" and the fields for the parameters will be nicely displayed
        please press "ENTER" after inserting the wanted field to go to the next field
        Here is an example:

        COMMAND: bestPrice
        INSERT fromCurrency = USD
        INSERT toCurrency = EUR

        THE GRAPH OF CURRENCIES:
        CAD is the SRC and
            EUR is the DEST at price 1.5

        USD is the SRC and
            CAD is the DEST at price 6
            EUR is the DEST at price 12


        BEST PRICE for USD-EUR is 9

    - for exiting the execution of the project just type "exit"
        Here is an example:
        COMMAND: exit
